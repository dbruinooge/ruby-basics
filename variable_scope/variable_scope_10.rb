# My guess: Line 6 generates an error. It is initializing a new local variable 'a' which will have an initial value of nil. Attempting to add nil plus iterations on the array [1, 2, 3] will generate an error. Aside from the error, line 11 would print 7 since the local variable initialized on line 6 is different from that outside the method initialized on line 1.
